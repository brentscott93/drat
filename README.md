## Brent's `drat` Repository 

Friends don't let friends install random Git commits...I've been a bad friend. Stable packages will be uploaded here (coming soon!).

### Stable versions of packages currently included are...

[*pagecryptr*](https://github.com/brentscott93/pagecryptr) - R-wrapper for encrypting HTML documents using Javascript, forked from [PageCrypt](https://www.maxlaumeister.com/pagecrypt/). 

[*lasertrapr*](https://github.com/brentscott93/lasertrapr) - Automated analysis of laser trap data. Still under heavy development as part of my dissertation so being able to place more stable versions in this `drat` repo is very nifty. 

### What is `drat`? 
From the source:

`drat` ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=drat), [GitHub](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat), [docs](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat)) makes it easy to host your own
CRAN-like repositories for packages (or [data](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-026/index.html)).

Many users have started their own `drat` repo by forking the original [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat)
