## Brent's `drat` Repository 

Friends dont' let friends install random Git commits...I've been a bad friend. Stable packages will be uploaded here (coming soon!).


## What is `drat`? 
From the source:

`drat` ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=drat), [GitHub](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat), [docs](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat)) makes it easy to host your own
CRAN-like repositories for packages (or [data](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-026/index.html)).

Many users have started their own `drat` repo by forking the original [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat)
